# WAYS - With All Your Senses

Some call it Gospel, others call it Soul, Rhythm&Blues or Popmusic.

We want to move along several ways in music.

We want to sing "Songs with a Meaning"!

With all your senses..

Dear friends,

because of the COVID-19 crisis, WAYS is also pausing until further notice with the rehearsals in the library of "our" retirement home on Kurfürstendamm. The health of our hosts of course is more important!

We will let you know when and where we will meet again, as soon as we know ourselves.

We still hope that we will perform the announced concerts.

Until then: you all stay healthy, keep some distance, watch each other and don't forget to sing.

With All Your Senses!

Your WAYSies!
