# WAYS - With All Your Senses

Some call it Gospel, others call it Soul, Rhythm&Blues or Popmusic.

We want to move along several ways in music.

We want to sing "Songs with a Meaning"!

With all your senses..

## News

### December 2020

Of course, WAYS continues to sing in the “winter lockdown”, too. Even without a mask. Zoom makes it possible for us to meet with Gunars each Monday. We practice diligently on NEW songs in three voice groups. True, everyone only sings for themselves at home and we can't hear each other, but we see and hear Gunars at the piano, we can ask questions and look into the familiar faces of the other WAYSies.

We are really eager to hear how the new songs will sound when we put this patchwork together in “real” rehearsals. There surely will be still a lot to do. You know how much we love all the little details. And at some point, somewhere we will introduce you to our new program in the rich WAYS sound. We miss our concerts and you!

The anticipation begins now!

If you would like to join us: simply call us on +49 178 2440085 or use the contact form.

Your WAYSies

### October 2020

Even in Corona times WAYS keeps going: from time to time we rehearse with our choir director in different locations outside (full 3 hours) or inside (2 times 30 minutes with a ventilation break). And on Sundays we sing in a small group in the park. When it rains we meet under the trees or in the parking deck. Most importantly, we all have fun and the sound is great!

If you feel like joining us: simply call us at +49 178 2440085 or use the contact form.

### May 2020

Dear friends,

because of the COVID-19 crisis, WAYS is also pausing until further notice with the rehearsals in the library of "our" retirement home on Kurfürstendamm. The health of our hosts of course is more important!

We will let you know when and where we will meet again, as soon as we know ourselves.

In the meantime, we continue rehearsing using video meetings so that we can be there for you again soon - with new songs.

Until then: you all stay healthy, keep some distance, watch each other and don't forget to sing.

With All Your Senses!

Your WAYSies!
