Our premiere at the Fête de la Musique: Finally, we get to be part of this magical event in musical Berlin and bring people together with „Songs with a meaning“. We’re hoping you’ll come, too.

Update on April 24th, 2020:

The organizers are currently considering moving the Fête de la Musique to a later date. But nothing has been decided yet. When the Passionskirche is available at the new date and organizes its choir festival we’ll certainly perform in the festival, too.
