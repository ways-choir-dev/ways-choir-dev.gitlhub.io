At the gospel music festival in Hanover called Gospelkirchentag (Gospel Church Day), we’ll be performing in a church on opening night with one or two other choirs. This is a really great opportunity for us to showcase our repertoire outside Berlin and we’re truly excited to see what the other choirs have in store and of course, to finally get to experience the legendary Gospelkirchentag atmosphere.

Edit:

Originally the Gospelkirchentag was scheduled for the weekend 10th-12th September 2020, but due to the corona pandemic, the festival had to be postponed to the 17th-19th  September 2021.
