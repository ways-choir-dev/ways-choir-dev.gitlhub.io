At the gospel music festival in Hanover called Gospelkirchentag, we’ll be performing in a church on opening night with one or two other choirs. This is a really great opportunity for us to showcase our repertoire outside Berlin and we’re truly excited to see what the other choirs have in store and of course, to finally get to experience the legendary Gospelkirchentag atmosphere.
