WAYS in CONCERT: 90 minutes for our fans and everyone who wants to become one. Our Pop-Soul/Gospel repertoire has grown: for instance, Gunars has arranged „Freedom“ by George Michael for us. We adore the new (and old) songs and cannot wait to hear what you think.

Update on April 24th, 2020:

Sadly we have to cancel this concert. In the current situation no one knows yet when events with 200 people will be allowed again.
